}
```

**Note:** 
- Transaction type and transaction date cannot be changed via update. If you need to change the date, please delete the record and create a new transaction
- If the transaction type for the existing transaction ID is 2 (sale), cost_per_unit will not required, value passed in to the API will be ignored.

#### Delete Transaction
```http
DELETE /api/products/{id}/transactions/{transactionId}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

## üèóÔ∏è Database Schema

### Products Table
- `id` - Primary key
- `name` - Product name
- `sku` - Stock keeping unit
- `current_wac` - Current weighted average cost
- `current_quantity` - Current inventory quantity
- `total_cost` - Total inventory cost
- `timestamps`

### Product Transactions Table
- `id` - Primary key
- `product_id` - Foreign key to products
- `product_name` - Product name at transaction time
- `product_sku` - Product SKU at transaction time
- `transaction_type` - 1=Purchase, 2=Sale
- `transaction_date` - Date of transaction
- `quantity` - Transaction quantity (positive for purchase, negative for sale)
- `unit_cost` - Cost per unit
- `total_cost` - Total transaction cost
- `wac_before` - WAC before transaction
- `wac_after` - WAC after transaction
- `quantity_before` - Quantity before transaction
- `quantity_after` - Quantity after transaction
- `timestamps`

## üéØ Business Rules

### Transaction Rules
1. **First Transaction**: Must always be a purchase. If you add a backdated transaction, it will check if it is earlier than the first transaction. If yes, it can only be purchase.
2. **Sale Validation**: Cannot sell more than available inventory. If you add a backdated transaction for sale, it will check if the quantity at that point of time is enough for sale or not. If not, it will be blocked.
3. **Date Constraints**: Transactions cannot be more than 30 days earlier than the latest transaction. Usually after end of month account closing, it must not be changed anymore. Stricter way should be we shouldn't allow edit or delete for transaction from last month. However, in real world, it seems like this is not always the case.
4. **WAC Calculation**: Automatically calculated for purchases, and preserved for sales. Random date transaction will recalculate the wac for all subsequent transactions
5. **Negative Inventory**: System prevents negative inventory situations. Updating or deleting existing transactions will be blocked if it will cause negative inventory in any of the subsequent transactions
6. **Audit Trail**: Historical product data captured at transaction date

### WAC (Weighted Average Cost) Calculation

**For Purchases:**
```
New WAC = (Current Total Cost + Purchase Cost) / New Total Quantity
```

**For Sales:**
```
WAC remains unchanged (uses current WAC for cost calculation)
```


### Features that can make the system better
1.  **User tracking**: As of now, system doesnt track who is the one who add, update or delete a transaction. Once system sign in, they will be updating a transaction and the transaction is viewable by anyone who register via the system. If this is a project for my friend running e-commerce business, I will setup a simple hosting for him, create a simple frontend, and hide the register account API.
2.  **Product binding to user**: If we tie the product to user, we can make this to be a SAAS project. Each user who register, will have their own product. We also will need to create API to allow product creation.
3.  **Product binding to company**: If we create company module, link the product to company instead of user, and link the user to company, we can allow multiple user to update same product for their company.
4.  **Role & permissions for user**: If we allow company user to create role and permission, to limit their other users activity, such as only Super Admin can do update and delete, general admin can only create new transaction and create new product, this will be an even better SAAS project.
5.  **Selling price record**: If we record the selling price too, not just how many quantity is sold, we can generate a good report to calculate how much profit they earn on each transaction.
